In this assignment you’ll learn the basics of HTTP.

#### Synopsis

*   **Practice**
*   **Time**: 1:00h
*   **Goals**: [subgoal 7][s7]
*   **Due**: 3 a.m. the day of [lab 4][w4lab]

#### Tips

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

Take about 1 hour to follow the [transfer][] tutorial through to completion.

Install it with:

```sh
npm install cmda-be/transfer --global
```

…and then start it by running `transfer`.
This tutorial is interactive.
Answer any questions it asks you, until completion.

If you completed the tutorial, mark this assignment as complete by opening an
issue on our [GitHub issue tracker][transfer-issue].
In your issue, show us a cheat sheet you made of HTTP and how it works.

In this assignment you’ll apply your HTTP knowledge in Node by building a static
file server.

#### Synopsis

*   **Practice**
*   **Time**: 5:00h
*   **Goals**: [subgoal 5][s5] and [subgoal 7][s7]
*   **Due**: 3 a.m. the day of [lab 4][w4lab]

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

Take ± 5 hours to create a static file server in Node.js without any frameworks
(so no express).
You may use small modules (such as [`mime-types`][mime-types]) but make sure
to hand in considerable own work.
Hand in your project as a new repository on GitHub under your username.
In your project, create a `package.json` manifest with relevant metadata and
make sure all your dependencies are listed.
Document your project, its features, and usage in a `readme.md` file.

Your static server should:

*   Respond with 200 OK and a file if it’s requested (if `/about.html`
    is requested the server should respond with the contents of that file so
    the browser can render it)
*   Respond with a correct `Content-Type` header (if `/images/avatar.png`
    is requested the server should respond `Content-Type: image/png` so the
    browser can show it)
*   Respond with 404 Not Found and a useful (for non-technical people) HTML
    page saying that the file could not be found (if `/nonexistent-file.html`
    is requested the server should send a nice document that the browser can
    display)
*   Respond with 200 OK and an `index.html` file if it exists (if `/assets` is
    requested and `/assets/index.html` exists, the server should respond with
    the contents of that file as if `/assets/index.html` was requested instead)
*   Respond with 200 OK and a list of files in the directory if no `index.html`
    exists (if `/images` is requested and `/images/index.html` **does not**
    exists, the server should respond with a nice looking list of files in the
    `/images` directory)

If you have some time left, add a license, a `.gitignore`, and other useful
files.
Finally, push your project to GitHub.

If you pushed your work, mark this assignment as complete by opening an issue
on our [GitHub issue tracker][listing-issue].
Include a link to your repository.
Let us know in the issue if you liked this assignment, and give us any feedback.

Your project will be reviewed and receive feedback, so expect people to read it,
and be ready for tips and tops!
